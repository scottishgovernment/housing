The tenant must tell the local council and utility companies that Council Tax, water and sewerage charges
should be in the tenant’s name. The landlord may also do so. The tenant will have to pay the
Council Tax, water and sewerage charges unless the tenant is exempt for any reason. For example, if the
tenancy states the rent includes such charges, or if full time students live in the property, Council
Tax may not need to be paid. A tenant living alone can also apply to the Council to receive a discount
on their Council Tax.

The tenant must tell the local council when the tenancy starts and then when it ends.

<p>
If the tenant thinks that he or she doesn’t need to pay Council tax or other charges, the tenant needs to
apply to the local council Revenues & Benefits department to get an exemption. It will not be given without
the tenant making the application.
