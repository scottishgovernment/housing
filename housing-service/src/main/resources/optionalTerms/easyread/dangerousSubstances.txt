The tenant must safely store any petrol and/or gas, including liquid petroleum gas, which the tenant
uses for garden appliances, barbecues or other household goods or appliances.  This means keeping it
outside the property if possible (for example in a shed in the garden) and stored in leak proof and
fire proof containers.

The tenant must not store or keep any other flammable liquids, explosives, or explosive gases which
