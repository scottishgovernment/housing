<p>
The tenant needs to get the written consent of the landlord, in advance, before the tenant brings any animal
or pet into the property.   It's up to the landlord whether or not the landlord gives this consent.
</p>

<p>
If the Agreement bans pets, a tenant can ask the landlord to change it to allow an assistance dog if the
tenant is disabled and needs an assistance dog to be able to live in the property.   If the landlord refuses,
they may be discriminating on the grounds of disability and could be acting illegally.
</p>

<p>
If the landlord does agree that the tenant can keep an animal or pet in the property, the tenant must make
sure that the animal or pet is kept under supervision and control.  This is to ensure that the pet does not
cause damage to the property or common areas and is not a nuisance to neighbours or others in the area.
</p>

<p>
If the landlord agrees to allow a pet then they might request an additional deposit on top of the deposit
they would usually charge.   This is to acknowledge the greater potential for damage and costs at the end
of the tenancy.  The total amount of the deposit paid by the tenant,  including this extra deposit cannot
be more than 2 months' rent.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the Agreement, the landlord can ask the tenant to repay the cost of any damage caused by,
or cleaning required due to, a pet.   The landlord should supply the tenant with copies of the receipts
for such costs.
