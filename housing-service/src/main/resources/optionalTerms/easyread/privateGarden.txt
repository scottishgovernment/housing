If the let property includes a garden, solely for the tenant's use (so not shared with anyone else), the tenant
must maintain that garden in a reasonable manner.    The landlord might pay for garden maintenance to be carried
out and charge this cost as a service included in the monthly rent payments - this should be stated in the Agreement.
In that case, the tenant would only need to keep the garden area tidy.

If the tenant does not do this, then the landlord can do it instead and ask the tenant to pay back the costs.
The landlord should supply the tenant with copies of the receipts for such costs.
