<p>
If the tenant wants to smoke in the property (or allow others to smoke in the property) the tenant
must get the landlord's written consent, in advance.  This applies to tobacco smoking or the smoking
of anything else.

The tenant must not smoke (or allow others to smoke) in stairwells or other common areas.

<p>
If the tenant is not supposed to smoke in the property then at the end of the Agreement, the
landlord can ask the tenant to repay the cost of any damage caused by, or cleaning required due to,
smoking.   The landlord should supply the tenant with copies of the receipts for such costs.
