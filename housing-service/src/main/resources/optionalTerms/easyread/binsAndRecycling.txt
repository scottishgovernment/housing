The tenant must dispose of or recycle all rubbish in the correct way.
</p>

<p>
If rubbish is picked up from the street, then on the day it is due to be collected, it should be put out before
the time asked for by the local council.  Any rubbish and recycling containers should be returned to their normal
storage places as soon as possible after being emptied by the local council.
</p>

<p>
The tenant must also comply with the local councilâ€™s rules if they need to dispose of large items.  Sometimes a
local council might charge an extra cost to uplift a large item. The tenant can also arrange to dispose of large
items by taking them to the nearest recycling centre run by the local council.  Details of how to recycle large
items and days and times of refuse and recycling collections will be given on the local council's website for
the area in which the property is located.

<p>
If the tenant does not dispose of rubbish properly, the landlord can do it instead and ask the tenant to pay
back the costs.  The landlord should supply the tenant with copies of the receipts for such costs.
