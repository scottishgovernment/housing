The Tenant will maintain the garden in a reasonable manner.

Where the Tenant fails to maintain the garden in a reasonable manner and the Landlord incurs costs in bringing the
garden up to a reasonable standard at the end of the tenancy, the Landlord can apply to the relevant tenancy deposit
scheme to recover reasonable costs involved. If the reasonable costs involved are greater than the amount held by
the tenancy deposit scheme, the Tenant will remain liable for these costs, and the Landlord may take action to
recover these costs from the Tenant.
