The Tenant undertakes to ensure that the accounts for the supply to the Let Property of
[Gas, Electricity, Telephone, Internet / Broadband, TV Licence] are entered in his or her name with the relevant
supplier. The Tenant agrees to pay promptly all sums that become due for these supplies relative to the period
of the tenancy.

The Tenant agrees to make the necessary arrangements with the suppliers to settle all accounts for these services
at the end of the tenancy.

If there are any sums outstanding at the end of the tenancy incurred by the Tenant, the Landlord can apply to
the relevant tenancy deposit scheme for these costs to be deducted from any deposit paid by the Tenant. If the
costs involved are greater than the amount held by the tenancy deposit scheme, the Tenant will remain liable
for these costs, and the Landlord may take action to recover these costs from the Tenant.

The Tenant has the right to change supplier if he or she pays the energy supplier directly for gas or electricity.
This includes if the Tenant has a prepayment meter. The Tenant agrees to inform the Landlord if they choose to
change the utilities supplier, and to provide the Landlord with details of the new supplier.

If the Tenant allows the meter to be changed from or to a pre-payment meter during the tenancy, the Tenant is
responsible for the reasonable cost of changing the meter back over at the end of the tenancy, unless the
Landlord wishes it to remain.
