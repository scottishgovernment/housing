In the case of a flatted Let Property, or any other Let Property having common parts the Tenant agrees, in
conjunction with the other proprietors / occupiers, to sweep and clean the common stairway and to co-operate
with other proprietors/properties in keeping the garden, back green or other communal areas clean and tidy.

Where the Tenant fails in this responsibility, the Landlord may carry out these responsibilities and may apply
to the relevant tenancy deposit scheme for the reasonable costs involved. If the reasonable costs involved are
greater than the amount held by the tenancy deposit scheme, the Tenant will remain liable for these costs, and
the Landlord may take action to recover these costs from the Tenant.
