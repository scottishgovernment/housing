The Tenant will not keep any animals or pets in the Let Property without the prior written consent of the
Landlord.  Any pet (where permitted) will be kept under supervision and control to ensure that it does not
cause deterioration in the condition of the Let Property or common areas, nuisance either to neighbours or
in the locality of the Let Property.

At the end of the tenancy, the Landlord can apply to the relevant tenancy deposit scheme to cover the cost
of any damage caused by, or cleaning required due to, a pet.  If the costs involved are greater than the amount
held by the tenancy deposit scheme, the Tenant will remain liable for these costs, and the Landlord may take action
to recover these costs from the Tenant.
