The Tenant agrees that the signed Inventory and Record of Condition, [attached as Schedule 1 to this Agreement/ which
will be supplied to the Tenant no later than the start date of the tenancy] is a full and accurate record of
the contents and condition of the Let Property at the start date of the tenancy.  The Tenant has a period of 7 days
from the start date of the tenancy (set out above in the 'start date of the tenancy' section) to ensure that the
Inventory and Record of Condition is correct and either 1) to tell the Landlord of any discrepancies in writing,
after which the Inventory and Record of Condition will be amended as appropriate or 2) to take no action and, after
the 7-day period has expired, the Tenant shall be deemed to be fully satisfied with the terms.

The Tenant agrees to replace or repair (or, at the option of the Landlord, to pay the reasonable cost of repairing
or replacing) any of the contents which are destroyed, damaged, removed or lost during the tenancy, fair wear and
tear excepted, where this was caused wilfully or negligently by the Tenant, anyone living with the Tenant or an
invited visitor to the Let Property (see clause above on 'Reasonable care').  Items to be replaced by the Tenant
will be replaced by items of equivalent value and quality.
