ensure that the rubbish is properly bagged or recycled in the appropriate container.  If rubbish is normally
collected from the street, on the day of collection it should be put out by the time specified by the local
authority.  Rubbish and recycling containers should be returned to their normal storage places as soon as
possible after it has been collected.  The Tenant must comply with any local arrangements for the disposal of
large items.

If the Tenant fails to dispose of rubbish in an appropriate manner and the Landlord incurs reasonable costs in
the disposal of rubbish, the Landlord can apply for these costs to be deducted from any deposit paid by the Tenant.
If the reasonable costs involved are greater than the amount held by the tenancy deposit scheme, the Tenant will
remain liable for these costs, and the Landlord may take action to recover these costs from the Tenant.
