The Tenant agrees to dispose of or recycle all rubbish in an appropriate manner and at the appropriate time.
Rubbish must not be placed anywhere in the common stair at any time.  The Tenant must take reasonable care to
ensure that the rubbish is properly bagged or recycled in the appropriate container.  If rubbish is normally
collected from the street, on the day of collection it should be put out by the time specified by the local
authority.  Rubbish and recycling containers should be returned to their normal storage places as soon as
possible after it has been collected.  The Tenant must comply with any local arrangements for the disposal
of large items.
