If they do, the Tenant will be treated as being responsible for any such action and will be liable for the cost of
any repairs, renewals or replacement of items where required.

When allowing a person to occupy the Let Property with the Tenant as that person's only or principal home, the Tenant
must ensure that the Let Property does not become an unlicensed "house in multiple occupation" (HMO) (see SECTION 2:
GLOSSARY OF TERMS for definition of "house in multiple occupation").

The Tenant will be liable for reasonable costs and expenses, including if applicable, legal or court expenses, payable
by the Landlord or his or her Agent as a result of the accommodation being, as a consequence of the Tenant's breach,
deemed an unlicensed or unregistered "house in multiple occupation".
